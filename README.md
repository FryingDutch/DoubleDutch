# DoubleDutch: a distributed advisory lock

[![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/jessehl/LockManager/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jessehl/LockManager/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**DoubleDutch** is a C++ program that coordinates distributed access to shared resources, such as databases or file systems. Clients make requests to DoubleDutch, asking for exclusive usage of a resource (or permission to perform a one-time task). Once the client is finished (or timed-out), the lock is released and ready to be acquired by another client. This project is inspired by MySQL's `GET_LOCK` [function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/locking-functions.html#function_get-lock). DoubleDutch is a http(s) server, based on [CrowCpp](https://github.com/CrowCpp/crow/tree/master). 


## Usage

Any client that can communicate over http(s), can use the server. When using a Python client, a request to acquire a lock named `<lockname>` may look like:
```python
# try to acquire the lock:
r = requests.get("https://<host>:<port>/getlock?auth=randomapikey&lockname=<lockname>&timeout=3&lifetime=20")

#OR
r = requests.get("https://<host>:<port>/getlock?auth=randomapikey&lockname=<lockname>")
#-the default lifetime is 30 seconds.
#-the default timeout is 0 seconds.

```
When the lock on `<lockname>` was acquired, the server will return the following JSON:
```json
{
    "servername":    "DoubleDutch/<version>",
    "lockname" :     "<lockname>",
    "sessiontoken" : "<sessiontoken>",   
    "lockacquired" :  true 
}
```
If a lock could not be acquired, `"lockacquired"` and `"sessiontoken"` will be set to `false` and `""`, respectively. 

The client has to use the `<sessionToken>` (a random string of 32 chararcters) to release the lock.
When using a Python Client, a request to release the lock may look like this:
```python
r = requests.delete("https://<host>:<port>/releaselock?lockname=<lockname>&token="+token)
```
The result would be:
```json
{
    "servername"   : "DoubleDutch/<version>",
    "lockname"     : "<lockname>",
    "lockreleased" : true
}
```

To query the status of the server (and all of the locks that are currently active), you can request the `status`-endpoint. This will return the following JSON:
```json
{
    "servername" : "DoubleDutch/<version>",
    "status"     : "ok",
    "locks": [
        {
            "lockname" : "<lockname>",
            "sessiontoken": "<sessiontoken>",
            "remaining": 43.5
        }
    ]
}
```
  
## Installation and set-up
**Requirements:**  
DoubleDutch needs a _.crt_ file named "certificate.crt" and a _.key_ file named "privateKey.key", in order to run on https.  
You will have to place these files in the _SSL directory_.  
The program also uses authentication trough API Key verification. To set the API key, you edit the _config.txt_ file.  
  
DoubleDutch runs inside a Docker container. To build using the provided _Dockerfile_:
```bash
docker build . -t server
```
DoubleDutch needs at least the portnumber from the user.
To run and listen for connections on port 8000:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 server 8000
```
## Customisation
**Besides the default settings, DoubleDutch offers optional customisation.**

- **Name:** Give the server your own name.  
 This is especially useful when you want to use multiple servers for different applications.  
 By default this is "DoubleDutch/\<version\>".
```bash
n myServerName
```
- **Precision:** this effects the amount of time a thread sleeps(ms) in between cycles.  
 Specifically when a request is waiting for a lock to be freed and in the dedicated thread that checks the lifetimes of the locks.  
By default this is 333ms.
```bash
p 333
```
- **Threads:** The amount of threads the program will use.  
By default the program makes a hardware check to set the thread amount.
```bash
t 8
```
- **HTTPS:** If you want to disable HTTPS.  
 Only option here is 0 (which makes the program run on http).  
HTTPS is on by default.
```bash
h 0
```
- **.crt & .key:** setting the _.crt_ and _.key_ file.  
 The image expects to find a _certificate.crt_ and a _privateKey.key_ file to be found at the root ("/") of the container.
 DoubleDutch provides a template *docker-compose* file, which can be easily modified to set a custom path or filename.
 ```yml
secrets:
  key:
    file: D:\your\own\directory\certs\customkey.key # change this if you want to use https
  crt:
    file: D:\your\own\directory\certs\customcrt.crt # change this if you want to use https
```
- **API-key:** setting _config_ file path/name.   
 As with the SSL-files, the image expects a _config.txt_ at the root of the container. 
 And also with the API-key you can easily modify your own custom path or filename trough the provided *docker-compose* template.
 ```yml
API-key:
    file: .\config.txt # change this if you want to use a different file location/name for the API-key
``` 
 For other purposes, like testing, you can also pass it as an argument:
```bash
a myRandomApiKeyString
```

## Replication and fault-tolerance
Distributed locks are used for roughly [two reasons](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html):
- **Efficiency**: Taking a lock saves you from unnecessarily doing the same work twice (e.g. some expensive computation).
- **Correctness**: Taking a lock prevents concurrent processes from stepping on each othersâ€™ toes and messing up the state of your system.  

When your locks fall in the latter category, it is _currently_ difficult to deploy DoubleDutch in a fault-tolerant way. If, on the other hand, it does not matter that clients _accidentally_ acquire the same lock, you can use Double Dutch with your favourite container orchestrator (e.g. [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)). In that case, you can have the orchestrator take care of spinning up another (single) DoubleDutch instance when one of the nodes in your cluster goes down.
