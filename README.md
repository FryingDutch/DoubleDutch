# DoubleDutch: a distributed advisory lock

**DoubleDutch** is a C++ program that coordinates distributed access to shared resources, such as databases or file systems. Clients make requests to DoubleDutch, asking for exclusive usage of a resource (or permission to perform a one-time task). Once the client is finished (or timed-out), the lock is released and ready to be acquired by another client. This project is inspired by MySQL's `GET_LOCK` [function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/locking-functions.html#function_get-lock). DoubleDutch is a https server, based on [CrowCpp](https://github.com/CrowCpp/crow/tree/master). 


## Usage
Any client that can communicate over http(s), can use the server. When using a Python client, a request to access the `database` resource may look like:
```python
# try to acquire the lock on the database:
r = requests.get("https://<host>:<port>/getLock?auth=randomapikey&lockname=lock_as_string&timeout=3&lifetime=20")

#OR
r = requests.get("https://<host>:<port>/getLock?auth=randomapikey&lockname=lock_as_string")
#-the default lifetime is 30 seconds.
#-the default timeout is 0 seconds.

```
 If the lock to the resource was granted, the client will receive a random string of 32 chararcters that will be needed to release the lock later.
 When using a Python Client, a request to release the lock may look like this:
```
r = requests.get("https://<host>:<port>/releaseLock?lockname=lock_as_string&key="+key)
```
  
## Installation and set-up
DoubleDutch needs a .crt file named "certificate.crt" and a .key file named "privateKey.key", in order to run. 
You will have to place these files in the SSL directory.

The program also uses authentication trough API Key verification. To set the API key, you just edit the config.txt file.

DoubleDutch runs inside a Docker container. To build using the provided _.Dockerfile_:
```bash
docker build . -t server
```
To run and listen for connections on port 8000 with default thread amount (8) and default precision(333ms):
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 server 8000
```
To run and listen for connections on port 8000 with 12 threads and default precision(333ms):
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 server 8000 t 12
```
DoubleDutch allows you to change the precision of the application. This effects the time between each cycle in which the program looks for a free lock during a reuqest, or if a lock lifetime has been expired(dedicated thread). At default, the application does 3 cycles each second(333ms) for both of these functions.

To run and listen for connections on port 8000 with default thread amount (8) and custom precision(ms):
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 server 8000 p 500
```

To run and listen for connections on port 8000 with custom thread amount and custom precision(ms):
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 server 8000 p 100 t 15
#OR
docker run -p 8000:8000 server 8000 t 12 p 250
```

## Cluster mode
Distributed locks are used for roughly [two reasons](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html):
- **Efficiency**: Taking a lock saves you from unnecessarily doing the same work twice (e.g. some expensive computation).
- **Correctness**: Taking a lock prevents concurrent processes from stepping on each othersâ€™ toes and messing up the state of your system.  

When you're using DoubleDutch for the latter reason, you cannot use DoubleDutch in cluster mode. When employing DoubleDutch for efficiency reasons, though, you can easily spin up multiple instances (on different servers). In that case, you have to ensure that the clients are aware of all the hostnames. When one server is down, clients can try to acquire a lock at the 'next' DoubleDutch instances. 

## Known issues and limitations
- No way to signal (Ctrl + c) the server to stop. Can stop running by closing the terminal. (The exit protocols will still run that way).
